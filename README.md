# Chunky Benchmark

## How to run
1. Build the jar
2. Run the jar with `--input "esspooltest" --threads 8 --libs "libs/" --self "build/libs/ChunkyBenchmark.jar" -o "test.csv" --runs 100 --mix`
where input is the input scene, libs is the path to the chunky core libraries to benchmark, self points at the current jar, or can be left out, o is the output file, runs specifies the number of runs, mix specifies if the run order should be randomized.
